    " - Consulting web pages that may have a solution to a given homework problem or one similar is cheating.  However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",
    " - Copying a segment of code or math solution of three lines or more from another student from a printout, handwritten copy, or by looking at their computer screen \n",

    " - Working on a HW problem on your own first and then discussing with a classmate a particular part in the problem solution where you are stuck.  After clarifying any questions you should then continue to write your solution independently.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how a particular construct in the language works.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how to formulate a particular construct in the language.\n",
    " - Asking someone for help in finding an error in your program.  \n",
    " - Asking someone why a particular construct does not work as you expected in a given program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether you are truly doing your own work and retaining what you've learned you should be able to easily reproduce from scratch and explain a HW solution that was your own when asked in office hours by a TA/Instructor or on a quiz/exam.   \n",
