    "Regularization is the formal term that describes the process of limiting a model’s complexity, often with the aim of reducing overfitting and allowing for more generalizable models. Here, we start by considering Ridge Regression, also termed L2 Regularization (this is very similar to the LASSO Regression or L1 Regularization we discussed in lecture - the difference is the regularization term involves squaring the parameters instead of taking their absolute value.  Visually this means instead of restricting our parameter region to a box shape, we'll be restricting it to a ball shape). \n",

    "As an alternative and more realistic example, instead of using only the first N features, we can use various different regularization strengths. For example, for really low regularization strengths (e.g. $\\alpha = 10^{-12}$), we get a model that is nearly identical to our linear regression model. This regularization term is so small you may even get a `LinAlgWarning`. Below, we import `Ridge`, which initializes a model similar to `lm.LinearRegression` but applies Ridge Regression.\n"

However, doing so requires more computation resources as we'll have to fit K models per hyperparameter choice.\n",

To select between various features, various models, or various hyperparameters, we split the training set further into multiple temporary train and validation sets (each split is called a \"fold\", hence k-fold cross validation). We will use the average validation error across all k folds to make our optimal feature, model, and hyperparameter choices. In this example, we'll only use this procedure for hyperparameter selection, specifically to choose the best alpha."
