Every time a boat passes under the bridge, cars must stop while the bridge is raised to accommodate the height of the boat.  As both boat and car traffic increases, city planners are considering building a new taller bridge that will never impede the flow of traffic. As part of a larger simulation of traffic congestion, you need to decide how to model the arrival of boats at the bridge.  From your Intro to Data Science class you remember that the time _between_ independent arrivals are usually modeled by an Exponential distribution.  Finally, you have access to a report that says on average 10 boats cross under the bridge per day.\n",
